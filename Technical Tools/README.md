# 📌 **Difference Between PxPlus Data Dictionary & Relational Databases**

| Feature | **PxPlus Data Dictionary** | **Relational Database (SQL: MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)** |
|---------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Data Storage** | Uses **ISAM files** (Indexed Sequential Access Method) | Uses **tables stored in SQL databases** |
| **Structure** | Defines field names, data types, and relationships **inside PxPlus** | Uses a **structured schema with tables, columns, and constraints** |
| **Query Language** | PxPlus supports **SQL-like queries**, but mainly works with native file handling | Uses **SQL (Structured Query Language)** for data retrieval |
| **Indexing** | Supports **file-based indexing** for faster lookups | Uses **B-Tree and Hash Indexing** for optimized queries |
| **Data Relationships** | Supports **basic relationships** inside the dictionary | Provides **complex relational constraints (FOREIGN KEYS, JOINS, etc.)** |
| **Integration** | Works with **PxPlus applications directly** | Can be accessed by multiple applications via SQL |
| **Scalability** | Best for **small to medium-sized applications** | Suitable for **large-scale enterprise applications** |
