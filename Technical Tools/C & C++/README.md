#  Understanding C & C++ in Payroll Processing
**C** and **C++** are powerful, high-performance programming languages widely used in payroll processing systems due to their speed, memory efficiency, and legacy system compatibility.

## What is C++?
- C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.
- C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.
- C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.
- The language was updated 5 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2023 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, and C++23.

## Why Use C++
- C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.
- C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.
- C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
- C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
- C++ is fun and easy to learn!
- As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.

## Object-Oriented Language (OOP) - Simple Explanation

An **Object-Oriented Language (OOP)** is a programming language that is based on the concept of **objects** and **classes**. Instead of writing code in a procedural way (step by step), OOP organizes code into reusable and interactive **objects**.

### Key Concepts of OOP:
- **Objects**: Real-world entities (e.g., a Car, a Person) that have properties (data) and behaviors (functions).
- **Classes**: Blueprints or templates for creating objects.
- **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data and methods together.
- **Inheritance**: A way to reuse code from another class.
- **Polymorphism**: One function can work differently based on context.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details.

## Difference between C and C++
- C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax.
- The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ supports classes and objects, while C does not.

## Classes & Objects in C++

### **Class:**
A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions).

### **Object:**
An **object** is an instance of a class. It has its own copy of data members and behaviors.
